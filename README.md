# AmUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

This library was created for the purpose of having my angular learnings over past years collected in one place. The library will also serve as a refernece for creating components in my future application developments using angular.. In an effort to create a library of UI components I look forward to learn best practices and other advanced topics in Angular JS.

Let me start small with few components and improve upon. I would be adding documentation in between via a demo app. This readme serves as a placeholder until the project forms some shape.

# AmUi Demo

For live demo [click here](https://am-ui.netlify.com).
The demo project is currently using netlify for Build and deploy. It is configured to be autodeployed via netlify for every new checkins.

## Local Development

First run `ng build am-ui` to build the library which will place the lib-code in the distribution folder. Then `ng serve am-ui-demo` in another console to serve the demo project and point your browser to http://localhost:4200 for seeing the demo project in action.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Netlify build commands
ng build && (ng build am-ui-demo --prod)

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
