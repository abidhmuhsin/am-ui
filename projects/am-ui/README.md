# AmUi

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

This library was created for the purpose of having my angular learnings over past years collected in one place. The library will also serve as a refernece for creating components in my future application developments using angular.. In an effort to create a library of UI components I look forward to learn best practices and other advanced topics in Angular JS.

Let me start small with few components and improve upon. I would be adding documentation in between via a demo app. This readme serves as a placeholder until the project forms some shape.

## Local Development

First run `ng build am-ui` to build the library which will place the lib-code in the distribution folder. Then `ng serve am-ui-demo` in another console to serve the demo project and point your browser to http://localhost:4200 for seeing the demo project in action.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project am-ui` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project am-ui`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project am-ui` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build am-ui` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build am-ui`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/am-ui` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test am-ui` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
